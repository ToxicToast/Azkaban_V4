## Infrastructure

- Docker (Containerization)
- Kubernetes (Orchestration)
- Traefik (Reverse Proxy)
- Kafka (Message Broker)
- MariaDB (Database)
- NestJS (Backend Framework)
- Redis (Cache)
- ReactJS (UI)
- Redux-Toolkit (State Management)
- API Alerts (Alerting)
- OpenTelemetry (Tracing)
- SigNoz (Tracing - Visually)

## Gateway

> **Info:**
> The Gateway is the entry point for all requests to the services. It is responsible for routing requests to the correct service and publishes the correct Topic to the Message Broker.

## Alerting

> **Info:**
> Great Service for Alerting. It is used to monitor the API Post Requests which will notify me on my mobile that something new was created or a specific user logged in. (Event Driven Architecture)

- [API Alerts](https://apialerts.com/)

## SSE

> **Info:**
> To have some sort of Realtime Communication between the Services, the SSE Service is used to publish Events to the UI. Since i don't want to use Websockets (and I don't need some sort of bidirectional communication), I've decided to use Server Sent Events.
